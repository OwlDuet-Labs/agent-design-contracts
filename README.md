A framework for designing and building AI-driven systems using specialized roles and machine-readable design contracts.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **📖 For detailed setup instructions, see the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

```bash
# Install the ADC tool
pip install -e .

# Install AI provider packages (choose one or more)
pip install -e ".[anthropic]"  # For Claude
pip install -e ".[openai]"      # For GPT
pip install -e ".[gemini]"      # For Gemini
pip install -e ".[all]"         # All providers

# Initialize ADC project structure
adc init                        # Creates contracts/, adc_files/, claude_tmp/

# Set up API keys
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"

## 0. Launch claude and run the following prompts
% cd my-repo
% claude

## 1a. Start from scratch: make contracts for a new project from a specification
as @adc-contract-writer create contracts based on my @docs/my-design-spec.md

## 1b. Initialize an existing repo: create contracts from software & add markers
as @adc-initialize initialize this project

## 2. Run the ADC agent loop
as @adc-workflow-orchestrator implement @contracts/ following a roadmap with phases

## 3. Refactor with the ADC agent loop
as @adc-refactorer implement specific refactor based a temporary contract

## 4. Evaluate and stress test the software (single agent)
as @adc-system-evaluator run my system and provide insights in ADC-INSIGHTS.md

## 5. Refine contracts (single agent)
as @adc-contract-refiner modify contracts based on recommendations in @ADC-INSIGHTS.md

## 6. Write code (single agent)
as @adc-code-generator implement implement and test this feature: ...

## 7. Audit again and again...
as @adc-compliance-auditor audit this new implementations @contract/adc-005-new-feature.md and@contract/adc-001-overview.md

## 8. Software not in compliance - so fix
as @adc-contract-refiner and @adc-code-generator fix the contracts and code based on the audit
```

## 📖 What is ADC?

**Agentic Design Contracts (ADC)** is a methodology that bridges the gap between system design and implementation through:

1. **Machine-readable contracts** - Design documents in a structured Markdown format that both humans and AI can understand
2. **Specialized AI agents** - Purpose-built agents for code generation, auditing, and refinement
3. **Traceable implementation** - Direct linking between design blocks and code through ADC-IMPLEMENTS markers
4. **Continuous validation** - Automated detection of design drift and compliance issues

### Key Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth**: Contracts serve as the authoritative design specification
- **Automated Development**: AI agents handle routine implementation tasks
- **Design-Code Parity**: Automatic verification that code matches design intent
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Shared language for developers, architects, and AI agents

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The ADC Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Outer["Outer Loop"]
        O[Orchestrator] --> E[System Evaluator]
        E --> |Insights| O
        O --> PR[PR Orchestrator - PR]
        PR --> Deploy[Deployment]
    end

    subgraph Inner["Inner Loop - Orchestrator manages"]
        Ref[Refiner] --> A1[Auditor]
        A1 --> |Not Compliant| CG[Code Generator]
        CG --> A2[Auditor]
        A2 --> |Not Compliant| CG
        A2 --> |Compliant| Commit[PR Orchestrator - commit]
    end

    O --> Ref
```

1. **Contract Writer** creates initial design contracts
2. **Auditor** reviews contracts for completeness and compliance
3. **Code Generator** implements the contracts
4. **Auditor** verifies implementation matches contracts (loop until compliance)
5. **System Evaluator** analyzes the compliant system for improvements
6. **Refiner** updates contracts based on evaluator insights
7. **Auditor** performs final validation
8. **PR Orchestrator** manages the deployment process

## 📝 Contract Schema

ADC contracts use typed design blocks to specify system components:

### Example Contract

```markdown
---
contract_id: "my-system-adc-001"
title: "My System Design"
status: "active"
version: 1.0
---

### [Agent: Data Processor] <data-processor-01>
Processes incoming data streams with validation and transformation.

**Persona:** Senior Data Engineer
**Thinking Process:**
1. Validate input format
2. Apply transformations
3. Output to storage

**Parity:**
- **Implementation Scope:** `src/processors/`
- **Tests:** `tests/test_processors.py`

### [DataModel: ProcessedData] <processed-data-01>
Represents processed data ready for storage.

- `id: str` - Unique identifier
- `timestamp: datetime` - Processing time
- `data: dict` - Processed payload

**Parity:**
- **Implementation Scope:** `src/models/processed_data.py`
```

### Block Types

- **`[Agent]`** - Autonomous agents with personas and algorithms
- **`[DataModel]`** - Data structures and schemas
- **`[Algorithm]`** - Business logic and calculations
- **`[Tool]`** - External services and integrations
- **`[Feature]`** - User-facing capabilities
- **`[TestScenario]`** - Test cases and edge cases

For complete schema documentation, see [adc-schema.md](adc-schema.md).

## 🤖 AI Agents

### Code Generator
- **Role**: Senior Staff Software Engineer
- **Purpose**: Transforms contracts into production code
- **Features**: Type hints, error handling, ADC-IMPLEMENTS markers

### Auditor
- **Role**: Principal Engineer & Systems Architect
- **Purpose**: Verifies code compliance with contracts
- **Detects**: Missing implementations, design drift, anti-patterns

### Refiner
